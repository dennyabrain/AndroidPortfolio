   			<h1>Loud Stream</h1>
   			<blockquote>Using a Men's public restrooms can be an awkward experience. There are no explicit etiquette other than the fact that we pretend that the other person does not exist and try to do our business as silently as possible. I made this app to assure the person standing next to me that we are together in this awkward journey. You set a timer as you enter the washroom and as you stand next to someone in the urinal, the phone that is in your pocket plays back a loud sound file to diffuse the tension. </blockquote>
   			<h3>Technical Details</h3>
   				<p>I used the Alarm Class to act as the timer and the Android Media Player class plays back the mp3 file.</p>
